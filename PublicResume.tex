    \end{wrapfigure}
    With 15 years of experience in the software engineering and
    computer security fields, I have successfully researched,
    designed, implemented, maintained and delivered many successful
    projects in a wide variety of roles with a very broad spectrum of
    subject matter.\\
    
    Security is a primary focus because it affords an opportunity to
    constantly learn new and interesting things. Everything needs a
    level of security, and using that as an entry point, there will
    always be broad and ever-expanding aspects of technology to
    explore.\\
    
    \textbf{Skills:}
    \begin{resumeitemize2}
    \item{\textbf{General}: Security, R\&D, Reversing, Exploiting, Networking, Performance, Embedded}
    \item{\textbf{Languages}: C, C++, Ruby, Python, Assembly, Shell scripting, Lisp, Java, \LaTeX}
    \item{\textbf{Architectures}: X86, X86\_64, ARM, PIC, OpenRISC, Z80, ATmega }
    \item{\textbf{Software}: Linux, Windows, GCC, Clang, GDB, Emacs, IDA, Autotools, CMake}
    \end{resumeitemize2}
    
    \textbf{Personal Interests:}
    \begin{resumeitemize2}
    \item{\textbf{Music}: Guitars, bass, drums, brass, synths and recently, a thrash metal ukulele}
    \item{\textbf{Home Improvement}: My first house has been keeping me busy with plenty of projects}
    \item{\textbf{Entertaining}: Inviting friends over for smoked meats, craft beers, and fine whisky}
    \item{\textbf{Career}: Attending conferences and local meetups to socialize and stay current}

    {Inverse Limit (for Google)}
    {

        As part of Google ATAP's \emph{Project Vault}, Inverse Limit's
        small team of 4 designed and developed a complete computer
        platform with a security focus. All components are open
        source; the board schematics, OS, applications, drivers,
        toolchain, emulator, and even the CPU (based on OpenRISC) have
        been released to GitHub. Among other things, I was solely
        responsible for implementing the real-time multitasking
        operating system for the project.\\
%        
%        Earlier in the project I was responsible for creating the initial software that used a fake FAT filesystem as a means of socket communication between an external device and an Android device without need for a kernel driver.\\

      {X86 Hypervisor and CPU Instruction fuzzer}
      {Inverse Limit (for DARPA)}
      {

        The MAIM project (Micro-architecture Instruction Mining) was
        one of three Cyber Fast Track proposals that DARPA accepted
        from Inverse Limit. It consisted of an x86 instruction fuzzer
        and a cross-platform hypervisor to execute the instructions
        and compare their behavior on different implementations. The
        project identified several undocumented differences between
        Intel, AMD and VIA architectures.\\

      {Complete TCP/IP Stack for Attack Traffic}
      {BreakingPoint Systems}
      {

        I redesigned BreakingPoint's existing network security test
        framework from a traffic simulator into a fully featured
        TCP/IP stack that could test live applications while
        transparently applying any number of advanced network evasion
        techniques. At the same time, by integrating concurrency into
        the new design and strategically replacing components with C
        extensions, the performance was quadrupled.}
