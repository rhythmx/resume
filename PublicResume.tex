    After 20 years of working in the realm of software engineering and 15 of
    those focused on entirely on cybersecurity, I have some level of experience
    in just about every facet of computing, and mastery in quite a few. My
    greatest skill, and why I currently find myself in consulting, is that I'm
    able to quickly absorb new subject matter and think outside the box.\\

    I've authored large software projects, audited source code and raw binaries
    for vulnerabilities, run penetration tests, reverse engineered firmware to
    verify features, rolled my own fuzzing frameworks, soldered this to that,
    wrote an operating system, and the list goes on. I have also honed my
    communication skills while authoring countless reports, whitepapers,
    presentations, and other media about all of the above, presenting them to
    coworkers, clients, and audiences at large for deep discussion.\\

    I was naturally drawn into the security space. I have always (ever since I
    could hold a screwdriver) liked to take things apart to see how they work. I
    like to imagine all the new and unexpected things that can be built out of
    all the bits and pieces. Working in computer security has always just that
    for me; breaking things down into components and getting to the ground truth
    of what is possible.\\

    \textbf{Skills:}
    \begin{resumeitemize2}
    \item{\textbf{General}: Security, R\&D, Reversing, Exploiting, Networking, Hardware, Automation}

    {Secure Embedded Operating System}
    {Inverse Limit (for Google)}
    {

        As part of Google ATAP's \emph{Project Vault}, Inverse Limit's
        small team of 4 designed and developed a complete computer
        platform with a security focus. All components are open
        source; the board schematics, OS, applications, drivers,
        toolchain, emulator, and even the CPU (based on OpenRISC) have
        been released to GitHub. Among other things, I was solely
        responsible for implementing the real-time multitasking
        operating system for the project.\\
%        
%        Earlier in the project I was responsible for creating the initial software that used a fake FAT filesystem as a means of socket communication between an external device and an Android device without need for a kernel driver.\\

      {X86 Hypervisor and CPU Instruction fuzzer}
      {Inverse Limit (for DARPA)}
      {

        The MAIM project (Micro-architecture Instruction Mining) was
        one of three Cyber Fast Track proposals that DARPA accepted
        from Inverse Limit. It consisted of an x86 instruction fuzzer
        and a cross-platform hypervisor to execute the instructions
        and compare their behavior on different implementations. The
        project identified several undocumented differences between
        Intel, AMD and VIA architectures.\\

      {Complete TCP/IP Stack for Attack Traffic}
      {BreakingPoint Systems}
      {

        I redesigned BreakingPoint's existing network security test
        framework from a traffic simulator into a fully featured
        TCP/IP stack that could test live applications while
        transparently applying any number of advanced network evasion
        techniques. At the same time, by integrating concurrency into
        the new design and strategically replacing components with C
        extensions, the performance was quadrupled.}
